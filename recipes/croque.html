    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic croque madame makes the perfect French-inspired brunch or lunch dish. Once you try this, it will be hard to have "just" a ham and cheese sandwich again. Don't cheat and use Swiss cheese, this deserves the real thing! Using Gruy√®re cheese will make all the difference.</p>
